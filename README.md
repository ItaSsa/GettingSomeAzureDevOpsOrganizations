# GettingSomeAzureDevOpsOrganizations
In this first project I want show one option for use Python and WIQL for consolidate workitens form all projets from many Azure Devops Organizations.<br />
In a real scenario, when the managers needs monitoring workitens from several Kanban boards, this is a option  how we can use Python for extract this data and put then in a intermediate base. <br />
The consolidate base can be source for one Power BI painel, for example, or other tool to effectively brings a monitoring needed.<br />
For this case, I created two Azure Devops Organizations and some projects under them. I created some "issues" for simulate the kanban boards workitens, like below images. <br />
